<p>The community of transgender women of color are facing an epidemic of violence. According to the Human Rights Campaign in 2017, twenty-eight transgender women of color were murdered, which is the highest deadliest year recorded (“Violence Against”, 2018). The Mic reports from 2010 to 2016, 72% of trans homicide victims were black trans women and femmes (Provenzano, Rodriguez, Solis & Swartz, 2016). Sadly, the Advocate Magazine reports as of September 2018, at least 20 transgender women of color have been murdered (Ring, 2018). These women have been murdered or abused, by their acquaintances, partners and strangers. Majority of these cases are based on transphobia.</p>

<p>The goal of iGotchu is to educate the public about trans identities and trans violence, to help aid in creating a transphobia free society.</p>
